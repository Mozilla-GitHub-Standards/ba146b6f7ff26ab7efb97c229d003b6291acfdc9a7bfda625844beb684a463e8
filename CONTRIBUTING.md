Contributing to the Risk Heat Map
=================================

Though this is largely a project used internally at Mozilla, we'd love contributions. Docs, bug reports, questions, suggestions, etc are all great!

Components
-----------
This repository is the source for the base site (which authenticates against our SSO provider), the basic menu and the dashboard for the risk heatmap itself. 

The dashboard for the observatory is located [here] ( https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory-dashboard )


Bug Reports
-----------
Anything security sensitive sensitive, please report it via [Bugzilla] ( https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Enterprise%20Information%20Security&component=General )

Anything not security sensitive, feel free to file a github issue in the repository for the component you are targeting.
